# Open-Source Humanity

This is the Word of Itself.

Open-source Humanity is the process of actively knowing which version of truth you share with those around you. The scale is unknown, but itself has this origin. 

It's a method of rediscovering and repurposing the wisdom of our *Shared-Humanity* in a manner that is manageable with the help of technology and the undying willingness for cooperation. Without wisdom, technology, and cooperation we are left with nothing. So we shall move forward with this commonly held belief together. 

Its aims are to revolutionize the way we identify ourselves within our lineage and in our potential. 

To grasp within our hands the keys of great civilization we must look within ourselves to find *Elemental-Truths*. Those are truths of character that which only we ourselves know the answer, to us they seem eternal. We then must build on top of these truths a manifestation in the flesh, that in way of a shared commonality with those around us. This commonality should be cherished and celebrated in a regimented manner, for without common goals we have nothing.

The activation of Open-Source Humanity shall set forth great motivation from individuals to find commonality within Humanity. 

At the very core is this notion: individuals contain within themselves the capability and willingness to embody and manifest Good Will.

* We first must rediscover our Humanity.

* Secondly we must sort its vastness into meaningful actions.

* Thirdly we must codify only our most elemental truths into open-source doctrine. Readable and writable by all with the help of version control software.

* Fourthly we must manifest these truths in the flesh.

* Fifthly we must celebrate in great joy with those who share these truths, for truth is meaning.

* Lastly, we must propagate only messages of good will. For absent all else, good will is the only element worthy of maintaining.

This process initiates when you understand the meaning of this message and manifest what you believe to be true in the flesh. This process may illuminate the path of our *Shared-Origin*, thus we shall walk together towards meaning. This is a path towards *Higher-Intelligence*.
